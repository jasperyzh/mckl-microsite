                    <p class="">“The whole academic and practicum of this course has been carefully
                        crafted to give a holistic insight into the social work worldview. It covers
                        as many subjects as possible to give us an overall core of what social work
                        is all about. The two internship exposures were tremendously priceless as
                        well. It is not only about getting more knowledge, values and skills, but
                        also the ability to translate what we learned into our workplace.”

                        Work, I looked at the syllabus and timetable and it was well-rounded. It
                        covered most aspects of social work; psychology, sociology, law and policy
                        and working with the target community (internships). It also fit my criteria
                        of not having to take a break off my work commitment because the classes
                        were during the weekends.”
