                        <p>Mr Joshua Johnson</p>
                        <h6>Biography</h6>
                        <p>Joshua has been working with tertiary students at different
                            capacities since graduating from university. His current
                            role for the past 9 years is to counsel, help, engage and
                            interact with pre-university students, as they decide on
                            what to study at university and which university to go to.
                        </p>
                        <p>He has (successfully) placed students in top universities in
                            the world including the ones in UK, USA, Australia, New
                            Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore. ‘Finding the right fit’ is
                            his motto, to ensure all students have a chance for tertiary
                            education despite their background and circumstances. </p>
                        <p>Joshua received his Bachelor of Communication (Hons.) degree
                            from Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang. Having passion to
                            engage with young people, he worked in an NGO for 7.5 years
                            that trained tertiary students, and for the past 9.5 years
                            has been in the University Placement Department of Methodist
                            College Kuala Lumpur. Currently, he heads the department,
                            and frequently engages with students, alumni, universities
                            and other stakeholders.</p>
